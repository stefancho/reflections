How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I used a FC cmd prompt windows utility, which I find really weird experience.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I enables you to have thematic commits and helps you to connect each part to certain functionality.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    This helps you to have thematically organized commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Again they are logically connected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I don't know yet.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can develop a new features in new branches and incorporate them to master only after you have tested them.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To complete this course.
